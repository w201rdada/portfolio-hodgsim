## The rise of microfinance

Paulette is a disabled single mother, living with her child in a busy town in Madagascar. She earns $900 per year working in a grocery store, but loves embroidery and believes that she could lift herself out of poverty by selling her work to tourists. She would need $650 to start a business, but that amount is far more than she could raise herself and no local bank would lend her that much without collateral.

The concept of microfinance was developed in response to situations exactly like this. The idea is that supporters lend small amounts to help borrowers in developing countries via a locally established Microfinance Institution (MFI). The industry has grown steadily since the 1970s and MFIs are now estimated by the World Bank to provide loans totaling $100 billion to approximately 200 million people. 

Despite the size and history of these programs, credit risk can be very difficult to assess because traditional indicators (such as credit history) do not exist for these recipients.
A loan that can't be repaid is bad for the borrower and depletes the capital of the MFI, leading to higher rates for everyone.
Using data science, we can use previous loan data to identify features that are more likely to lead to successful repayment and help MFIs make their capital funds last longer.

## Quantifying risk in the absence of traditional measures

Using a large, granular data set of individual loan type, characteristics and performance, the study would attempt to establish the probability of repayment across different loan types and examine whether these vary by region and gender. Data would be obtained from a US non-profit that works with 328 MFIs across the globe and has awarded over $2.6 million in loans. These results would allow MFIs to make better decisions and relay insights about successful businesses to help educate the people that they are trying to lift out of poverty.

## Impact of better insights

One ethical concern is whether improved risk analytics would change MFI behavior in a way that is detrimental to borrowers. MFIs may begin to restrict riskier loans that have a social benefit but a more indirect or long-term economic impact, such as those for medical procedures or home improvements. Additionally, this type of information, if used incorrectly, may stifle innovation or reinforce previous biases in loan allocations. The intention is not to further exclude people, but to allow the MFI to accurately assess its risk so that it can adjust rates and plan for the need to subsidize loans that are less commercially viable.

In order to carry out their fundamental mission to combat financial exclusion, non-profit MFIs should ensure that their actions are actually beneficial to their clients. In Paulette's case, they were. She set up a workshop, repaid her loan, and made enough profit to buy a plot of land. The insights from this study could help make this type of outcome more likely by helping MFIs to direct both capital and borrowers towards loans that have the best chances of repayment. With more certainty in their core loan portfolio, MFIs could better assess their capacity to make socially beneficial but less financially attractive loans.
