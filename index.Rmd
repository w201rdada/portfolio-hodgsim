### Abstract of my first cool idea

Record numbers of people in this country are overdosing on opioids, however, most deaths could probably be prevented by the timely administration of a cheap antidote. Unfortunately, the antidote itself is controlled drug, meaning that people (including first responders) require a prescription to possess it. Many states have tried changing their laws in various ways to make the antidote more widely available, but do these changes actually result in fewer overdoses? Can we measure the impact, and if so, which changes are most effective? Using a data set that shows the evolution of these laws across all states since 2000, along with overdose statistics, we can try to answer these questions.
