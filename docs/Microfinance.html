<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> The rise of microfinance</h2>
<p>Paulette is a disabled single mother, living with her child in a busy town in Madagascar. She earns $900 per year working in a grocery store, but loves embroidery, and believes that she could lift herself out of poverty by selling her work to tourists. She would need $650 to start a business, but that amount is far more than she could raise herself, and without collateral, no local bank would lend her that much.</p>
<p>The concept of microfinance was developed in response to situations exactly like this, whereby supporters could lend small amounts to help borrowers in developing countries, via a locally established Microfinance Institution (MFI). The industry has grown steadily since the 1970’s, and MFI’s are now estimated by the World Bank to provide loans totaling $100 billion to approximately 200 million people. Despite the size and history of these programs, the nature of the borrower is such that credit risk can be very difficult to assess.</p>
</div>
<div id="quantifying-risk-in-the-absence-of-traditional-measures" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Quantifying risk in the absence of traditional measures</h2>
<p>A loan that can’t be repaid is bad for the borrower and depletes the capital of the MFI, leading to higher rates for everyone. Traditional measures of credit risk are not available, but is it possible to use previous loan data to identify features that are more likely to lead to successful repayment?</p>
<p>Using a large, granular data set of individual loan type, characteristics and performance, the study would attempt to establish the probability of repayment across different loan types, and examine whether these vary by region and gender. This would potentially allow MFI’s to make better decisions, and relay insights about successful businesses to help educate the people that they are trying to lift out of poverty.</p>
<p>Data would be obtained from a US non-profit that works with 328 MFI’s across the globe, who have made over 2.6 million loans. One ethical concern is whether improved risk analytics would change MFI behavior in a way that is detrimental to borrowers. MFI’s may begin to restrict riskier loans that have a social benefit but a more indirect or long-term economic impact, such as those for medical procedures or home improvements. Additionally, this type of information if used incorrectly may stifle innovation or reinforce previous biases in loan allocations. The intention is not to further exclude people, but to allow the MFI to accurately assess it’s risk, so that it can adjust rates and plan for the need to subsidize loans that are less commercially viable.</p>
</div>
<div id="impact-of-better-insights" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Impact of better insights</h2>
<p>In order to carry out their fundamental mission to combat financial exclusion, non-profit MFI’s should ensure that their actions are actually beneficial to their clients. In Paulette’s case, they were. She set up a workshop, repaid her loan, and made enough profit to buy a plot of land. The insights from this study could help make this type of outcome more likely, by helping MFI’s to direct both capital and borrowers towards loans that have the best chances of repayment. With more certainty in their core loan portfolio, MFI’s could better assess their capacity to make socially beneficial but less financially attractive loans.</p>
