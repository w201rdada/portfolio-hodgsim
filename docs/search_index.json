["tackling-the-opioid-crisis-on-the-front-line.html", "Tackling the Opioid Crisis on the Front Line", " Tackling the Opioid Crisis on the Front Line Keywords Opioids, Overdose, Naloxone, Fentanyl, Drug Policy An immediate crisis Over 64,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2016, an increase of 21% over the prior year, making it the leading cause of death for people under 50. The vast majority of fatal overdoses involve opioids, and the number of deaths involving fentanyl (a synthetic opioid up to 100 times as potent as morphine) has increased from 3,000 three years ago, to over 20,000 last year 1. An emergency treatment called Naloxone is effective at reversing overdoses, however, it is a prescription medication and therefore not generally available to the public or first responders. Easier access to Naloxone could be a critical tool in the fight against deaths by overdose. A Front Line Response The underlying causes of the opioid crisis are complex, and lasting solutions will require a multi-disciplinary focus and potentially long term structural changes. This proposal seeks to address only one aspect, which is the immediate lethality of the current problem, by making resources available in a way that provides victims the best chance of survival. The first part of the study would examine the effectiveness of efforts to deregulate the distribution of Naloxone. These vary by state, and statutes range from the protection of doctors from criminal liability for prescribing Naloxone, to releasing laypeople from criminal or civil liability for using it, even if they acted without reasonable care. State-level data is available showing the introduction and progression of these statutes over time, beginning in 2001 2. The number of opioid related deaths could then be examined in light of policy at the time, after controlling for the mix of opioids and underlying growth in overdoses 3. This may reveal which types of legislation have the greatest impact, and whether the more costly and ethically questionable option of granting public access to Naloxone has a significant marginal effect when compared to providing it to first responders only. The results could then be used to help shape public policy. The second part would be to identify hotspots of fentanyl-related events, which can require multiple doses of Naloxone to deal with. Regional, non-random concentrations of overdoses may indicate its use by a local trafficker. Effective intervention would require access to contemporary and continually updated data, but it would allow first responders and other emergency staff to ensure that they are prepared with sufficient doses, and that they take proper precautions to avoid exposure to a highly toxic substance. Visualizations showing the location of events over time could provide valuable information to law enforcement, potentially helping to identify the source, spread and likely supply routes of fentanyl-tainted products. Desired Outcome The overall goal of the study is to provide information that can be used to maximize the availability of Naloxone in order to reduce preventable deaths. This will be done in two ways; first, by identifying the most effective legal framework that could be implemented and using the results to influence policymakers, and second, by ensuring that sufficient supplies are targeted to the areas where they are most required. 4 : Center for Disease Control, www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/health_policy/monthly-drug-overdose-death-estimates.pdf, https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D76/D15F907 5: pdaps.org/datasets/laws-regulating-administration-of-naloxone-1501695139 6 An assumption is made that greater access to Naloxone leads to greater availability. This could be examined by studying prescription rates. 1↩ 2↩ 3↩ 1↩ 2↩ 3↩ "],
["maximizing-the-impact-of-microfinance-initiatives.html", "Maximizing the impact of Microfinance Initiatives", " Maximizing the impact of Microfinance Initiatives {#fighting-poverty} Keywords Microfinance, financial inclusion, poverty reduction, sustainable development The rise of microfinance Paulette is a disabled single mother, living with her child in a busy town in Madagascar. She earns $900 per year working in a grocery store, but loves embroidery, and believes that she could lift herself out of poverty by selling her work to tourists. She would need $650 to start a business, but that amount is far more than she could raise herself, and without collateral, no local bank would lend her that much. The concept of microfinance was developed in response to situations exactly like this, whereby supporters could lend small amounts to help borrowers in developing countries, via a locally established Microfinance Institution (MFI). The industry has grown steadily since the 1970’s, and MFI’s are now estimated by the World Bank to provide loans totaling $100 billion to approximately 200 million people. Despite the size and history of these programs, the nature of the borrower is such that credit risk can be very difficult to assess. Quantifying risk in the absence of traditional measures A loan that can’t be repaid is bad for the borrower and depletes the capital of the MFI, leading to higher rates for everyone. Traditional measures of credit risk are not available, but is it possible to use previous loan data to identify features that are more likely to lead to successful repayment? Using a large, granular data set of individual loan type, characteristics and performance, the study would attempt to establish the probability of repayment across different loan types, and examine whether these vary by region and gender. This would potentially allow MFI’s to make better decisions, and relay insights about successful businesses to help educate the people that they are trying to lift out of poverty. Data would be obtained from a US non-profit that works with 328 MFI’s across the globe, who have made over 2.6 million loans. One ethical concern is whether improved risk analytics would change MFI behavior in a way that is detrimental to borrowers. MFI’s may begin to restrict riskier loans that have a social benefit but a more indirect or long-term economic impact, such as those for medical procedures or home improvements. Additionally, this type of information if used incorrectly may stifle innovation or reinforce previous biases in loan allocations. The intention is not to further exclude people, but to allow the MFI to accurately assess it’s risk, so that it can adjust rates and plan for the need to subsidize loans that are less commercially viable. Impact of better insights In order to carry out their fundamental mission to combat financial exclusion, non-profit MFI’s should ensure that their actions are actually beneficial to their clients. In Paulette’s case, they were. She set up a workshop, repaid her loan, and made enough profit to buy a plot of land. The insights from this study could help make this type of outcome more likely, by helping MFI’s to direct both capital and borrowers towards loans that have the best chances of repayment. With more certainty in their core loan portfolio, MFI’s could better assess their capacity to make socially beneficial but less financially attractive loans. "]
